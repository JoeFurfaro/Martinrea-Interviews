# 2022-23 Interview Design Challenge (Fall)

On the Autonomous Intelligent Vehicle team at Martinrea Alfield, you will be tasked with designing various interfaces for a diverse cast of stakeholders. One stakeholder group you will design for is the AIV core development team. This team relies on a set of developer interfaces that allow them to visualize and optimize what is happening in their code. These interfaces can drastically decrease development time. One of these interfaces is a live graph screen (part of our statistical analysis toolkit), where the developer can view live graphs of various statistics over a certain time interval. These statistics are sent to a web interface from the AIVs as a dense set of data points. These statstics include things like battery voltage, distance travelled, robot heading/angle, etc.

Your task as the UI/UX designer is to revamp this tool by coming up with a new design that meets all of your stakeholders' requirements. The core development team is not sure exactly what they want this interface to look like. However, they have stated that the interface should be intuitive to use, and that all data should be easy to find (not hidden deep in some secret menu!). Here are the requirements the development team has provided:

1. The interface must list all available graphable statistics
2. The user must be able to select which statstics they would like to graph from the list mentioned in requirement 1
3. The live graph must display datapoints for all statistics that the user has selected
4. The user must be able to control how long in the past they are viewing datapoints for (eg. 10s would should the last 10 seconds of datapoints, 30s would show 30 seconds, etc.)
5. All datapoints included in the selected time frame must be visible on the live graph
6. The graph interface must support showing multiple statistics simultaneously, providing isolated y-axes for each
7. The user must be able to "group" multiple statistics together onto one parent y-axis (the y-axis of one of the statistics being grouped)

Walk us through what steps you would take to solve this challenge. Feel free to ask us any questions that clarify the requirements or give you more context about the situation as a whole. I repeat, you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to ask questions.

By the end of your walkthrough, make sure you have completed the following:

- List stakeholders and justify why each stakeholder is in your list
- Explain how you might conduct research to better understand your stakeholders the requirements before building a prototype
- Design a LoFi or HiFi prototype either on paper or using a protyping tool of your choice (for example, Figma) (you will not be penalized for using paper to sketch your design)
- List any issues you expect may arise from your design in the future

Final note: We are not looking for a **perfect** design! We are looking to assess your understanding of the design process, and to see how you think, design, and problem solve in an unfamiliar scenario.
