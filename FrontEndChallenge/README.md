# 2022-23 Interview Front-End Challenge

On the Autonomous Intelligent Vehicle team at Martinrea Alfield, you will be tasked with implementing various web interfaces that will be used by a diverse cast of stakeholders. You will work closely with a UI/UX designer to implement their designs using a front-end web framework of your choice. These designs will vary in complexity and nature.

In this fictional scenario, the UI/UX designer has created a VERY basic design for a login screen for one of our administrative applications. On this login screen, the user is prompted to enter their phone number and password. The designer has supplied you with the following instructions:

The basic design without any interactions should match this prototype screenshot:

![Basic Design](ss1.png)

If the phone number field is not blank, and any phone number is entered that does not match the regular expression '^(\+\d{1,2}\s)?\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]\d{3}[\s.-]\d{4}$'

SCREENSHOT1 - Basic design, no interactions

SCREENSHOT2 - Invalid phone number

SCREENSHOT3 - Incorrect phone number or password

SCREENSHOT4 - Successful login, show result of HTTP request

In the next 25 minutes, your task as the front-end web developer is to implement this interface using a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack. You may also use any other tools, frameworks, or styling libraries you see fit, keeping in mind that the setup time for any of these tools counts towards the time constraint.

You are encouraged to ask any questions you may have that assist you in implementing the design. You can frame these questions as though we the UI/UX designers who sent you these screenshots of the prototype.

You are also strongly encouraged to make changes where you see fit that improve the overall user-experience of the interface. These changes could include making text more readable or improving the quality of form fields to lower the chance of user error. Please be sure to discuss your changes to us as though we were the UI/UX designers who built the prototype.
