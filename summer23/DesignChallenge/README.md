# 2023 Interview Design Challenge (Summer)
On the "insert name" team at Martinrea Alfield, you will be tasked with designing various interfaces for a diverse cast of stakeholders.

Your task as the UI/UX designer is to design this tool so that it meets all of your stakeholder's requirements

Please design a LoFi or HiFi prototype of an application that meets the requirements listed above (using a design/prototyping tool of your choice). Feel free to ask us any questions that clarify the requirements or give you more context. I repeat, you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to ask questions (it's part of the job)!

Final note: We are not looking for a **perfect** design! We are looking to assess your understanding of the design process, and to see how you think, design, and problem solve in an unfamiliar scenario.
