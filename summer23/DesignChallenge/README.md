Please design a LoFi or HiFi prototype of an application that meets the requirements listed above (using a design/prototyping tool of your choice). Feel free to ask us any questions that clarify the requirements or give you more context. I repeat, you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to ask questions (it's part of the job)!

Final note: We are not looking for a **perfect** design! We are looking to assess your understanding of the design process, and to see how you think, design, and problem solve in an unfamiliar scenario.
