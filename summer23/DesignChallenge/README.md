# 2023 Interview Design Challenge (Summer)
On the Process Innovation team at Martinrea Alfield, you will be tasked with designing various interfaces for a diverse cast of stakeholders. One example of this would be designing an app for our High Frequency Delivery Systems (HFDS) team. This team oversees the transportation of materials throughout the entire factory.

Currrently this team is discovering problems with bins being delivered to the wrong places by the forklift drivers. 
Below is an image of one of the forklifts used in our factory, and an image of one aisle in our "supermarket" where bins of parts are stored.

Below is a screenshot of the excel file the HFDS team uses to store the location of all of the bins in the factory. Currently, this chart is printed out and given to forklift drivers at the beginning of each of their shifts.

The team is looking to replace this file with a webapp that can be accessed on a tablet by the forklift drivers and managers. Your task as the UI/UX designer is to design this tool so that it meets all of your stakeholder's requirements

Please design a LoFi or HiFi prototype of an application that meets the requirements listed above (using a design/prototyping tool of your choice). Feel free to ask us any questions that clarify the requirements or give you more context. I repeat, you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to ask questions (it's part of the job)!

Final note: We are not looking for a **perfect** design! We are looking to assess your understanding of the design process, and to see how you think, design, and problem solve in an unfamiliar scenario.
